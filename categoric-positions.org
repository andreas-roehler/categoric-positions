* category theory is a synonym for algebra of functions

* The arrow represents function application

* Objects are types

* Types might be dependent types

* Morphism describe aspects of the type of functions.

* Set terminology isn't needed,
  but might be used in the context of dependend types

* Make sure Rusell's paradox is avoided:
  the term being defined can't be part of the definition.
